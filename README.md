![Image of deployed website](https://res.cloudinary.com/djbdldshh/image/upload/v1682384287/Am_I_Responsive_lkiian.png)



This is a full stack project created with Django, Python, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Html and CSS. This website was constructed to act as a website for the fictional Diner style restaurant ‘Mr D’z Route 66 Diner’. This website allows guests to make reservations & view the menu online.  

## User Experience (UX)

### Planning

The development of ideas for this website grew with UX principles in mind. I began to think about strategy and the demographic that would make up the patrons visiting the website. I planned the implantation of features that would best suit the demographic. 

Given that ‘Mr D’z Route 66 Diner’ is located along route 66, the vast majority of the diner’s patrons would be travelling so it is assumed that they will be visiting the website via their mobile phones. Creating a website that should be responsive and clearly visible on mobile screens was critical to the success of the website. 

### Demographic 

- Family groups
- Solo travellers
- Frequent customers (truckers, travelling sales people, etc...)
- Travellers using route 66 
- Customers who enjoy fast, convenient food

### What users will expect:

- A menu that is has descriptions of the food available and specifies any allergens
- An informative website that is simple to navigate 
- A reservation system so they can request a table
- A system that allows customers to manage their booking
- A contact form to contact the diner staff

### User Stories 

1. As a superuser, I can create, remove, update or delete menu items from the database so that I can ensure the menu items are accurate and that the menu is fully up-to-date.
2. As a superuser I can log in so that I can and access the backend of the website.
3. As a user I can send a contact form to the restaurant so that I can receive additional information.

6. As a user I want to see icons for the restaurant's social media pages so that I can follow the diner on different platforms.
7. As a user, I can see important information about the diner on the website's home page so that I don’t have to search the website for that information.
8. As a user, I can see a clear visual indication of my login status so that I can choose to be logged in or out.
9. As a user, I want to register for an account so that I can have my information saved and manage my reservations.
10. As a user, I can log in and I can edit/delete an existing reservation request so that I can make changes online if my plans change.

12. As a user, I want to be able to make a reservation request for a table for a specific date/time so that I will know if I have a table when I arrive.
13. As a user, I want to receive see a notification confirming my reservation has been submitted so that I know my reservation has been submitted. 
14. As a user, I can browse the restaurants' menu so I can decide what to order.


## Features

The colour palette I chose for this website is fun, electric and reflects the energetic atmosphere at Mr. D'z Route 66 Diner. Iwanted the user to get the impression from the website that Mr.D'z Route 66Diner was a lively establishment, so I choose a colour palette that bothcompliments and clashes in equal turns. The pastel pink as a background colour worksnicely to give the website a fresh colour wash without over-powering any of theimages, fonts or features on the website. I choose a bright red for the submit buttons to clash with that pastel pink without sacrificing the buttons' visibility.

## Scope

In order to achieve the desired user & business goals, the following features will be included in this release:

- Responsive navbar that will navigate to the various pages throughout the site
- Landing page with brief information about the restaurant.
- Menus page with descriptions, pricing and alergens listed.
- Reservations page, with a booking form that sends to the restaurant admin. 
- Manage reservations page, where logged-in users can edit/delete existing reservations they have.
- Update details page, for logged in users to update their details which in turn updates the customer model.
- Register/login feature using Django allauth


## Databases 

The Menus, Reservations and feedback apps require databases to store information so I have built 5 custom models.

### Menus

Menu & MenuItem are the model names for the menus app, these are two standalone models that provide all of the information required to display the items as part of the restaurant's menu. Each item has a name, description, price & allergens.

### Reservation

There are 2 models in this app, Customer & Reservation. The combination of these models allow for customer details to be stored, reservation enquiries to be made & managed.For each reservation, there will be a customer assigned to it. The customer is assigned during the enquiry process. This works for users that are logged in. 


### Feedback

The Feedback model allows customer, who and both logged in and not logged in, to send feedback to the admin where it is stored in a database. Each Feedback form requires a customers name or it cannot be submitted. A feedback form has a name, email, comments section and a rating dropdown menu.

## Deployment


The master branch of this repository has been used for the deployed version of this application.
Using Github & Gitpod

To deploy my Django application, I had to use the Code Institute Python Essentials Template.

- Click the Use This Template button.
- Add a repository name and brief description.
- Click the Create Repository from Template to create your repository.
- To create a Gitpod workspace you then need to click Gitpod, this can take a few minutes.
- When you want to work on the project it is best to open the workspace from Gitpod (rather than Github) as this will open your previous workspace rather than creating a new one.       
- Committing your work should be done often and should have clear/explanatory messages, use the following commands to make your commits:
    -git add .: adds all modified files to a staging area
    -git commit -m "A message explaining your commit": commits all changes to a local repository.
    git push: pushes all your committed changes to your Github repository.

### Creating an Application with Heroku

I followed the below steps using the Code Institute tutorial and Django Blog cheatsheat

- The following command in the Gitpod CLI will create the relevant files needed for Heroku to install your project dependencies pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt. Please note this file should be added to a .gitignore file to prevent the file from being committed. A Procfile is also required that specifies the commands that are executed by the app on startup.

- Go to Heroku.com and log in; if you do not already have an account then you will need to create one.
- Click the New dropdown and select Create New App.
- Enter a name for your new project, all Heroku apps need to have a unique name, you will be prompted if you need to change it.
- Select the region you are working in.

### Heroku Settings You will need to set your Environment Variables - this is a key step to ensuring your application is deployed properly.

- In the Settings tab, click on Reveal Config Vars and set the following variables:
        SECRET_KEY - to be set to your chosen key
        CLOUDINARY_URL - to be set to your Cloudinary API environment variable
- In the resources tab you must install 'Heroku Postgres'

### Heroku Deployment In the Deploy tab:

-Connect your Heroku account to your Github Repository following these steps:
        Click on the Deploy tab and choose Github-Connect to Github.
        Enter the GitHub repository name and click on Search.
        Choose the correct repository for your application and click on Connect.
    
- You can then choose to deploy the project manually or automatically, automatic deployment will generate a new application every time you push a change to Github, whereas manual deployment requires you to push the Deploy Branch button whenever you want a change made.
- Once you have chosen your deployment method and have clicked Deploy Branch your application will be built and you should see the below View button, click this to open your application.
