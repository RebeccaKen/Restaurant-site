This is a full stack project created with Django, Python, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Html and CSS. This website was constructed to act as a website for the fictional Diner style restaurant ‘Mr D’z Route 66 Diner’. This website allows guests to make reservations & view the menu online.  

## User Experience (UX)

### Planning

The development of ideas for this website grew with UX principles in mind. I began to think about strategy and the demographic that would make up the patrons visiting the website. I planned the implantation of features that would best suit the demographic. 

Given that ‘Mr D’z Route 66 Diner’ is located along route 66, the vast majority of the diner’s patrons would be travelling so it is assumed that they will be visiting the website via their mobile phones. Creating a website that should be responsive and clearly visible on mobile screens was critical to the success of the website. 

### Demographic 

- Family groups
- Solo travellers
- Frequent customers (truckers, travelling sales people, etc...)
- Travellers using route 66 
- Customers who enjoy fast, convenient food

### What users will expect:

- A menu that is has descriptions of the food available and specifies any allergens
- An informative website that is simple to navigate 
- A reservation system so they can request a table
- A system that allows customers to manage their booking
- A contact form to contact the diner staff
