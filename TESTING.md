## Epic 1: Core Functionality 

### User Stories

1. [Easy navigation of site](https://github.com/RebeccaKen/Restaurant-site/issues/12): As a user I can easily navigate through the website so that I can find the content I need.

2. [Important information on home page](https://github.com/RebeccaKen/Restaurant-site/issues/10): As a user, I can see important information about the diner on the website's home page so that I donâ€™t have to search the website for that information.

3. [Visible navigation bar and fixed footer](https://github.com/RebeccaKen/Restaurant-site/issues/13): As a user I can find a navigation bar and footer so that I can see what content there is on the website.

The homepage instantly provides the user with all information need to be able to navigate through the website & understand the ethos of the restaurant.

The navbar is easy to use and it is clear to the user which page they are currently on.

The footer is fixed and provides opening times and the restaurant's social media icons.
